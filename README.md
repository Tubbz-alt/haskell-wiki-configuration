No code here; this repository exists solely for [issue tracking][1].

This issue tracker is for bugs and feature requests for the
[Haskell Wiki][2].  This is just for issues with the
installation/maintenance of the wiki software itself (which is an
installation of [MediaWiki][3]).  For issues with the *content* of the
wiki, just edit the wiki! ðŸ˜ƒ
