This issue tracker is for bugs and feature requests for the
[Haskell Wiki][1].  This is just for issues with the
installation/maintenance of the wiki software itself (which is an
installation of [MediaWiki][2]). It also includes the customized wiki skin and some customizations to the configuration.

For issues with the *content* of the wiki, just edit the wiki! ðŸ˜ƒ
